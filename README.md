This repository contains a Python-based computer vision system designed to analyze PCB conformal coating quality using image processing and AI techniques.
The system focuses on UV-based coating inspection, detecting coating coverage, defects, and non-uniform areas in accordance with IPC guidelines.

🔍 Project Overview

Conformal coating is critical for protecting PCBs against moisture, dust, and chemical exposure. Manual inspection is time-consuming and subjective.
This project automates the inspection process by analyzing images of coated PCBs captured under UV illumination, where the coating appears in a distinct blue tone.

⚙️ Key Features

📷 Image analysis of PCB coating under UV light

🟦 Detection of coated vs. uncoated areas

📊 Coverage evaluation and defect highlighting

🤖 AI / computer vision–based decision logic

📁 Organized dataset of PCB images (good / bad coating samples)

🧪 Designed to align with IPC coating inspection principles
